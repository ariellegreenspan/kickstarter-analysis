##Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
###Overview of Project: The purpose of this analysis was to determine the overall success or lack thereof of different Kickstarter campaigns in reaching their financial goals needed to fund various entertainment projects in different countries. One factor involved in said analysis was whether the month that the theater campaigns were launched played a role in campaign success or failure. The financial goal of different plays were also examined to determine if that affected campaign success.  
###Analysis and Challenges: In order to perform my first analysis of theater outcomes based on launch date, I needed to create a pivot table. I selected all the data in my initial spreadsheet "Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx". Then I inserted a pivot table onto a spreadsheet that I labelled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date." After this, I filtered my table by category and year, and placed the outcomes as colums in the table. I put the date created conversion in the rows of the pivot table, and then made the values for the table be count of outcomes. I further filtered my pivot table to only include "theater" in the category outcomes of the table. I then grouped the data for the launch date by  month. One challenge I faced was grouping the data by month since Ithe data for launch date was organized by year. I ended up figuring out ho to dogrou the data by month using the information found at 'https://www.pryor.com/blog/grouping-excel-pivottable-data-by-month/ed which showed me how to right click data in the table and select gouping to organize it by month. 
###Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
